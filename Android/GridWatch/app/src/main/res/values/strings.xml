    <string name="consent_dialog">"GridWatch is a participatory sensing platform and a research project led by the University of Michigan.\n\n GridWatch is designed to crowd-source the sensing of power outages and power restorations. This will build a dataset that will help ensure that the power you are provided is reliable by both helping the utility companies better serve you and by helping researchers understand how the power grid is performing, leading to new innovations. \n\n All data collected by GridWatch is collected in order to increase the accuracy in which the app can sense power outages and restorations. For a walkthrough of the sensing methodology, please go to http://grid.watch. \n\n  Data collected can include; network metadata, cellphone metadata, audio, location, acceleration and other sensor readings. The GridWatch app allows for location sampling to be opted out of at anytime. \n\n Through the GridWatch app, you are able to view and delete all personal data collected by GridWatch. When you request your data to be deleted in app, you will receive confirmation of the deletion in app. \n\n By consenting below, you grant the University of Michigan and its research partners the right to publicly release all of all data gathered by this app, after this data have been made to be anonymous.  \n\n The University of Michigan and its partners agree to not seek any profit from the collection of this information. \n\n For any questions, please contact gridwatchdev@gmail.com."</string>

    <string name="page1">GridWatch helps you report power outages to your utility company.</string>
    <string name="page2">It gives you a button to report an outage with one click.</string>
    <string name="page3">It also automatically senses outages. Let’s walk through how this works.</string>
    <string name="page4">Step 1: When your phone is charging and then stops, GridWatch realizes there might be an outage.</string>
    <string name="page5">Step 2: GridWatch looks to see if you have unplugged your phone by checking to see if it has been shaken.</string>
    <string name="page6">Step 3: GridWatch listens for hum from nearby electrical power or generators.</string>
    <string name="page7">Step 4: If GridWatch can’t hear any hum, it sends a report over the Internet to the GridWatch analysis center where it is relayed to your utility company!</string>
    <string name="page8">GridWatch uses only 200 Bytes of data per report. This is about as much as 1 SMS</string>
    <string name="page9">Watching a couple YouTube videos will have more drain on your battery life than GridWatch will in a year.</string>
    <string name="page10">All the information GridWatch gathers is made available for free. \n\n
        You can see it at www.grid.watch</string>
    <string name="page11">You are able to remove your personal data and control how GridWatch senses at any point through this app.</string>
    <string name="page12">We encourage you to read more about GridWatch here. \n\n
        This is a project from the University of Michigan, the University of California and IBM Research Africa.</string>
